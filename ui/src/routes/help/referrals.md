# Referrals

To use Spline, you connect your Ethereum wallet to the dApp using the "Connect Wallet" button.

Your Ethereum wallet **address** looks something like this: `0x96619cD92Fe0c7dEaaEE1C8043a7FEA79CfA3E71`.

This address uniquely identifies your wallet, and it works sort of like a social media username in some ways.

## Affiliate Links

Furthermore, you can use this "username" to invite others to Spline, using what is called an _affiliate link_.

If another wallet is referred by your affiliate link uses Spline, you will **indefinitely** receive **30%** of their fees.

There is no limit on the amount of wallets that you can refer to Spline.

_You don't have to register for anything - it just works automatically!_

Here's an example affiliate link: `https://spline.fi/#a=0x96619cD92Fe0c7dEaaEE1C8043a7FEA79CfA3E71`.

But... that's kind of long for a username, isn't it?

What if we could use another decentralized technology to make our affiliate link a bit more easy to share and remember?

### Using ENS

The Ethereum Name Service is a protocol built on top of Ethereum that enables users to register "ENS domains".

ENS domains are wallet aliases and end in a ".eth" suffix.

For example, if `0x96619cD92Fe0c7dEaaEE1C8043a7FEA79CfA3E71` registers `example.eth`, the latter can be used as shorthand for the first.

Thus, the following affiliate links would both be correct and correlate to the same wallet:

-   `https://spline.fi/#a=0x96619cD92Fe0c7dEaaEE1C8043a7FEA79CfA3E71`
-   `https://spline.fi/#a=example`

Notice how the ".eth" suffix is **not included** when using an ENS referral link!
