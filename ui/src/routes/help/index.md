# Introduction

Spline is a _simple_ and _unique_ Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol that enables _optimized yield generation_.

It's permissionless, trustless, immutable, and 100% open-source.

## Yield Generation

The primary function of Spline is to democratize _capitally efficient_ yield generation.

Also called "yield farming", yield generation is the process of lending cryptocurrencies to borrowers and passively receiving interest without going through a middleman.

However, the rate at which this interest is received is very _variable_, meaning it changes all the time!

Some yield farms might have an APY of 4,000,000% one day (yes, really), and an APY of 40% the next.

So, we created Spline - which optimizes for consistently maximizing return and harvesting interest at the right times.

Besides, constantly having to manually find and switch to the most profitable pools is an exhausting challenge.

## Yield Aggregation

This is where _yield aggregators_ come into play. Yield aggregators compile pools across different DeFi pools so that users can quickly compare rates.

However, these yield aggregators are built on Layer 1, the congested highway of the Ethereum network which recently has seen enomoursly high gas fees.

That's why we built Spline! Spline is a yield aggregator that bridges to existing liquidity on Layer 1, but is built on a Layer 2 called _Arbitrum_ so that fees are exponentially lower.

## Vaults

That brings us to vaults!

Vaults are immutable, secure bridges between Layer 2 scaling solutions and Layer 1 liquidity.

In other words: way less fees, way more efficiency!
