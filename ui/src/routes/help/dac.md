# DAC

Spline is a DAC, or _Decentralized Autonomous Corporation_.

DACs are a subclass of DAOs, or _Decentralized Autonomous Organizations_.

The general takeaway here is that Spline is a for-profit DAO, tokenized into digital "shares" that pay dividends.

Run entirely on the blockchain and external to the traditional legal system, Spline's corporate structure, governance, and processes work a bit differently.

Spline was created by two co-founders:

-   _nathan.eth_, a semi-onymous cryptographer and blockchain developer.
-   _defipunk.eth_, a pseudonymous software engineer and blockchain developer.

## $SPL Token

Remember how we said that Spline is split into dividend-paying tokens?

### Purpose

The $SPL token provides a way for those interested in Spline to get involved and participate in governance.

It also incentivizes tokenholder contributions to the protocol that optimize the protocol's revenue.

### Tokenomics Overview

The Spline protocol is 100% liquid and tokenized into 1,000,000 $SPL tokens.

**Each token entitles its holder to exactly 0.0001% of Spline's revenue**, paid out every 24 hours in $LINK.

We call these payments _dividends_, though their structure differs from dividends of traditional financial products.

There can never be more than 1,000,000 $SPL tokens.
